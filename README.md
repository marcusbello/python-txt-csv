# txt-to-csv
python email txt leads converter to csv 

Creating different rows/column for your txt email files, so as to use filter on it
i.e if your email list is like this

thegit@github.com, theman@google.com, thegirl@yahoo.com


This script will turn it to something like this

thegit,thegit@github.com,github,*****t@github.com

theman,theman@google.com,google.com,*****n@google.com

thegirl,thegirl@yahoo.com,yahoo.com,*****rl@yahoo.com


So, basically what this script do is just to edit txt email files and save it to csv in this format

Name,Email,Domain,filterEmail


Will appreciate any help, am still new on both python and github

Thanks
